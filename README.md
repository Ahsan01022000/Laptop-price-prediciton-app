Overview
Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor app, a powerful tool that predicts the price of laptops based on various features such as CPU brand, RAM, storage type, screen size, and more. Using machine learning models, this app provides an estimated price for laptops based on user input.

Features
User Input: Users can input details about the laptop, including CPU brand, RAM size, storage type, and other specifications.
Machine Learning Model: The app uses advanced machine learning models like XGBoost to predict the price of the laptop based on the provided specifications.
Real-Time Predictions: As users fill in the information, the app provides a real-time price estimate.
Data Visualization: Provides visual cues and insights to help users understand the price range for different laptop configurations.
Installation
To run the app locally, you’ll need Python 3.6+ installed. Follow these steps:


streamlit run app.py
The app should now be accessible on http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Enter Laptop Specifications: Use the provided dropdowns and input fields to enter your laptop’s specifications.
Select CPU Brand, RAM, Storage Type, etc.
Predict the Price: Once all details are filled in, the app will predict the estimated price of the laptop based on the machine learning model.
View Results: The predicted price will be displayed at the top of the page.
Machine Learning Model
The app uses a RandomForest Regressor model to predict laptop prices. The model is trained on a dataset containing various laptop specifications and their corresponding prices. The features used for training include:

CPU Brand
RAM Size
Storage Type (HDD, SSD, Hybrid, Flash Storage)
Screen Size
Other important hardware features
